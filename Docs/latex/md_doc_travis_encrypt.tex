The trickiest part of all this is that you want to give Travis the ability to run your deploy script and push changes to gh-\/pages, without checking in the necessary credentials to your repo. The solution for this is to use Travis's \href{http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/}{\tt encryption support}.

We'll generate a Git\-Hub personal access token (essentially an application-\/specific password) and encrypt it, then put the encrypted version in our {\ttfamily .travis.\-yml} file. Then we can check in the {\ttfamily .travis.\-yml} file with no issues.

First, generate a token at \href{https://github.com/settings/applications}{\tt https\-://github.\-com/settings/applications}

Then, install the Travis client and do

``` travis encrypt G\-H\-\_\-\-T\-O\-K\-E\-N=$<$secret github=\char`\"{}\char`\"{} generated=\char`\"{}\char`\"{} token=\char`\"{}\char`\"{} here$>$=\char`\"{}\char`\"{}$>$ ```

This will give you a very long line like

``` secure\-: \char`\"{}$<$.... encrypted data ....$>$\char`\"{} ```

If you don't want to install Ruby/\-Ruby\-Gems and such, there are reports that the \href{http://npmjs.org/travis-encrypt}{\tt travis-\/encrypt} npm package works just as well.
