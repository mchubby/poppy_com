If your M\-C\-U is not already compatible with this librairy you have to create your hown H\-A\-L (Hardware Abstraction Layer).

The creation of a new H\-A\-L is a big contribution to this project and you will have to pull-\/request it in the future. To do a good pull request create a new git branch at the poppy-\/com master level and put all your code inside. When your new H\-A\-L is fully operational please pullrequest your branch to contribute to the poppy-\/project.

Start your new hal by creating a new folder on poppy-\/com/hal/

You can choose the name of your M\-C\-U on your Makefile but you have to give exactly the same name to your new poppy-\/com/hal/\-M\-C\-U folder.

You can use the H\-A\-L template in poppy-\/com/hal/template/

If you have any question about hal creation please ask!
